We're building a publicly-owned political dialogue platform.

As a nonprofit that's building open-source technology, Asq.Us is bridging the gap between you and your elected officials. 

This is the 'townhall' of the 21st century.

By using the internet, we can finally connect the people that make up America's democracy.
